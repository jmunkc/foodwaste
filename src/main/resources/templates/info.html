    <p>Globally, there are approximately 1.3 billion tons of food waste annually. So what is happening to reduce food waste in Denmark? From apps to advocacy groups, there are a host of ways to get involved.</p>

    <h1>Ways To Reduce Food Waste</h1>
    <h3>1. Adopt a healthier, more sustainable diet</h3>
    <p>Life is fast-paced and preparing nutritious meals can be a challenge, but healthy meals don't have to be elaborate. The internet is full of quick healthy recipes that you can share with your family and friends</p>
    <h3>2. Buy only what you need</h3>
    <p>Plan your meals. Make a shopping list and stick to it, and avoid impulse buys. Not only will you waste less food, you’ll also save money!</p>
    <h3>3. Pick ugly fruit and vegetables</h3>
    <p>Don’t judge food by its appearance! Oddly-shaped or bruised fruits and vegetables are often thrown away because they don’t meet arbitrary cosmetic standards. Don’t worry - they taste the same! Use mature fruit for smoothies, juices and desserts.</p>
