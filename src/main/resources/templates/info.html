<h1 class = "header">Ways To Reduce Food Waste</h1>

<div class="hero">
    <p>Globally, there are approximately 1.3 billion tons of food waste annually. So what is happening to reduce food waste in Denmark? From apps to advocacy groups, there are a host of ways to get involved.</p>
    <p>The term “food waste” refers to food that is discarded, but which is still fit for human consumption. The way this food is lost varies: produce left in fields, bruised in transport, or deemed aesthetically unpleasing for selling. Some of this waste is unavoidable, but most of it is.</p>
    <p>The environmental impact of food waste is staggering: 8-10% of all greenhouse gases are produced by the food we waste. According to Project Drawdown, the world’s leading resource for climate solutions, fighting food waste ranks third as one of the most impactful things we can do to curb climate change, and be can all contribute.</p>
